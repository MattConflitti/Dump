# Dump

This app utilized Exponent and React-Native to create an interface for the Startup Weekend GR pitch competition. Dump is the AirBnB of parking. I worked closely with Karlo Zadro to hack together this app in a day. Since we had no time to spare, the code may look a bit forced messy, but we were able to create what you can see below in the gif. If we were to continue development there would be a lot of refactoring.
